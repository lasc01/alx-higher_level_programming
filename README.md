# ALX High-Level Programming Projects

## Description
This repository contains my solutions and projects for the **ALX High-Level Programming** track. It covers fundamental and advanced concepts in high-level languages like Python, JavaScript, and others, focusing on:
- **Syntax mastery** and best practices  
- **Algorithmic thinking** and problem-solving  
- **Data structures** implementation  
- **Software development** principles  

## Technologies & Languages
- **Python** (Scripting, OOP, Data Structures)  
- **JavaScript** (ES6+, Node.js basics)  
- **Bash Scripting** (Automation tasks)  
- **SQL** (Database interactions)  
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, VS Code  

## Projects

   - Variables, loops, functions  
   - File I/O and exception handling  
2. **OOP Principles**  
   - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism  
3. **Data Structures**  
   - Lists, stacks, queues (Python implementations)  
4. **Algorithm Challenges**  
   - Sorting, searching, recursion  
5. **Web Scraping** (Optional)  
   - BeautifulSoup/Requests in Python
